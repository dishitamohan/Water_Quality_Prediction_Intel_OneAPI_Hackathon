XGBoost is a popular and powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification and regression tasks. It stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is an implementation of gradient boosting machines. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance, as well as its ability to handle large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces. It has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of machine learning tasks, making it a popular choice among data scientists and machine learning practitioners
 
 The model uses the dataset to check the suitability of water for consumption, by training a machine learning model to predict the target variable in the dataset, It is trained on a set of features that include various water quality parameters such as pH, Iron, Nitrate, Chloride, Lead, Zinc, Turbidity, Fluoride, Copper, Odor, Sulfate, Conductivity, Chlorine, Manganese, Total Dissolved Solids, Water Temperature, Air Temperature, Day and Time of Day. The model achieves very high accuracy in its predictions, indicating that it is able to accurately identify whether water is suitable for consumption based on the given features. This could be a valuable tool in ensuring access to safe and sanitary water supplies. Overall, this code demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in addressing important environmental issues such as freshwater scarcity.
