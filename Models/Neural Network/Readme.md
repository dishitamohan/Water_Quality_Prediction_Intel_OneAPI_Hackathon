# Neural Networks (NN)
Neural Networks, often referred to as deep learning models, have gained prominence in machine learning due to their ability to handle complex, high-dimensional datasets effectively. They are a powerful choice for various tasks, including predicting water quality based on multiple water parameters. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Data Preprocessing:
The code begins by loading the dataset and addressing missing values. Missing values in each column are filled with the mode of that column, ensuring data completeness.

## Class Distribution Analysis:
The code analyzes the class distribution, which is crucial for binary classification tasks. It visualizes the frequency of each class (suitable and unsuitable water) using a bar plot.

## Data Distribution and Outlier Detection:
The distribution of numerical features is visualized using histograms, showing the density of values for each feature. Additionally, box plots are used to detect outliers in the numerical features.

## Encoding Categorical Data:
Categorical columns ('Source,' 'Color,' and 'Month') are encoded into numerical values using Label Encoding, making them suitable for machine learning models.

## Correlation Analysis:
A correlation matrix heatmap is generated to visualize the relationships between numerical features. The heatmap helps identify potential correlations between variables.

## Handling Class Imbalance:
The code addresses class imbalance using the Random Over-sampling technique from the imbalanced-learn library. This technique balances the dataset by oversampling the minority class.

## Feature Scaling:
MinMax scaling is applied to standardize the feature values within a specified range.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
PCA is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining 95% of the variance. This dimensionality reduction can help improve model performance and reduce computational complexity.

## Neural Network Model:
A feedforward neural network model is built using the Keras library. The model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. Dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

## Model Evaluation:
The code evaluates the neural network model's performance on the test data using various metrics, including ROC curve, AUC score, precision-recall curve, average precision score, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Threshold Optimization:
The optimal threshold for classification is determined based on the F1 score. Different threshold values are tested, and the one that maximizes the F1 score is selected.

## Threshold Analysis:
The code analyzes the F1 score concerning different threshold values, providing insights into how the model's performance changes with varying thresholds.

## Conclusion:
The analysis concludes that the neural network model performs well in predicting water quality suitability for consumption. It achieves a high F1 score of approximately 0.793, indicating a good balance between precision and recall. The threshold value that maximizes the F1 score is found to be approximately 0.606.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation for water quality prediction using a neural network. It demonstrates good predictive performance and provides valuable insights into the model's behavior.
